    <string name="helpDescription">Craps is a game of chance where a player (the shooter) will roll 2
        six-sided dice. The sum of the die will determine whether the player
(and anyone that has placed a bet) wins immediately, loses
immediately, or if the game continues. If the sum of the first roll
of the die is equal to 7 or 11, the player wins immediately. If the
sum of the first roll of the die is equal to 2, 3, or 12, the player
has rolled "craps" and loses immediately. If the sum of the first
roll of the die is equal to 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10, the game will
continue with the sum becoming the "point". The object of the game is
now for the player to continue rolling the die until they either roll
a sum that equals the point or they roll a 7. If the player "makes their point", they win. If they roll a 7, they lose.</string>
